# the-cirqle-assignment

## Notes
- No packages were used
- Tried to add TypeScript towards the end but wasn't able to get the configuration working properly. Not a lot of good documentation on this subject and ChatGPT also wasn't able to give any answers.
- Chose to not use Quasar because I wanted to experiment myself with similar components & features.
- I kept the layout and styling very simple as this was not my focus for the project. This project was also a "crash course" for me and thus I tried to focus more on Vue js things.
